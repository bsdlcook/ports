## Maintained FreeBSD ports collection

The ports categorized by group in this repository have been merged into the FreeBSD ports tree, and are currently being maintained by me. If you have any issues/errors/improvements either create a merge request/issue/whatever is relevant to the problem or submit a [bug report](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/), alternatively shoot an email to [vulcan@wired.sh](mailto:vulcan@wired.sh). For a more detailed breakdown visit my [repology](https://repology.org/maintainer/vulcan%40wired.sh) page.

### Adhoc ports

There's also a small collection of personal ports, not merged into the tree and for my own usage, which can be found on the [adhoc branch](https://gitlab.com/lcook/ports/tree/adhoc).
