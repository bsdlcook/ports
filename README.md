## Maintained FreeBSD ports collection

The ports categorized by group below have been merged into the FreeBSD ports tree, and are currently being maintained by me. If you have any issues/errors/improvements either create a merge request/issue/whatever is relevant to the problem or submit a [bug report](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/), alternatively shoot an email to vulcan[at]wired[dot]sh.
#### sysutils
- [ufetch](https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/ufetch/), [pfetch](https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/pfetch/), [ansible-sysrc](https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/ansible-sysrc/).

There's also a small collection of personal ports, not merged into the tree and for my own usage, which can be found on the [adhoc branch](https://gitlab.com/nihilism/ports/tree/adhoc).
